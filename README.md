# 🩺 Insurance Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a health insurance dataset to understand how features like age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and region impact medical charges.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **File**: `insurance.csv`
- **Features:**
  - `age`: Age of the insured person
  - `sex`: Gender
  - `bmi`: Body Mass Index
  - `children`: Number of dependents
  - `smoker`: Smoking status
  - `region`: Residential region in the US
  - `charges`: Medical insurance cost billed

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 EDA Highlights

- Analyzed the distribution and statistics of key features like age, BMI, and charges.
- Visualized relationships between:
  - **Smoking status and charges** (smokers have significantly higher medical costs)
  - **BMI and charges** (particularly high for obese individuals)
  - **Age and charges** (generally increasing with age)
- Explored correlations using heatmaps and pairplots.
- Identified potential outliers and skewness in data.

## 📈 Visualizations

- Histogram of charges
- Box plots for smoker vs. non-smoker
- Pairplot for age, BMI, and charges
- Correlation heatmap

_All plots generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn._
